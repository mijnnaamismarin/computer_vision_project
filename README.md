## Repository Structure

The repository consists of the following python files:

    sort_label.py - Python script for manual preprocessing of the SOBA_v2 dataset.
    train_classifier.py - Python script for loading in the dataset and training a machine learning model.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the SOBA_classification dataset, which can be accessed through the following link.

To use this dataset with the scripts in this repository, follow these steps:

    Download the SOBA_classification dataset from the provided Google Drive.
    Extract the dataset in the root directory of this project.
    Update the dataset paths in both the train_classifier.py and training.py scripts.
    
If you want to preprocess the data again through the sort_label.py you follow the same steps but now download the SOBA_v2 dataset from the Google Drive
